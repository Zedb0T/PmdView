# Pmdview

## What is this
This is a tool to view 3D models in Mort the Chicken (slightly modified libgs PMD files with animations in the form of vertex lists). As of this commit it's messy and I can't be bothered to refactor what's needed because I have already sank two weeks into this project.
## Why
Bored
## Where are the releases
I'm too lazy to build a release right now
## The imgui panel has z testing
I know I'm keeping it like that because it's really fucking funny

## To do
- Refactor some stuff
- Make the ply export code work again
- Make a COLLADA export maybe
- Support the Dreamcast "pmd" files (they really are not PMDs)
- Lock the mouse
- Implement shader that fixes the colours (just multiply frag colour by 4x)
- Fix transparency
- Add back the VRAM export thing
- Figure out if I can properly make models for XNA with quads and indices instead of a triangle list
- Add a bounding box around objects and prim gps
